# soarers-files

This folder contains all of the files that are provided by Soarer over at [DeskAuthority](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2510&start=). I have combined the tools and configs folders from v1.10 with the firmware and docs folders from v1.12 in order to have the updated files. I have also created a batch file for flashing the bootloader of the ATMega32u4 with the included firmware.

I <i><b>in no way</b></i> take responsibity for creating or modifying these files, all credit goes to Soarer.
