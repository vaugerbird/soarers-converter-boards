# Soarers-Dongle

Like the description says, this is just a simple dongle adapter for converting an IBM Model M with RJ45 plug to USB through various methods. I whiped up the PCBs in about an hour each, so there might be errors in the PCB design. If there is, file an issue report and I'll fix it right away! Also, please do not plug an ethernet cord into the dongle or keypad, as it might do weird things (or nothing at all)!

I've included the EAGLE PCB files for all of the boards, their respective BOMs, and all of Soarer's files relevent to the PCBs. I <i><b>in no way take</b></i> responsibity for creating or modifying the files in the soarers-files folder, all credit goes to Soarer. If you want more info on the original project, check out Soarer's guide [here](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2510&start=).
