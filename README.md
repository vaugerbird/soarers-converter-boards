# Soarers-Dongle

Like the description says, this is just a simple dongle adapter for converting an IBM Model M with RJ45 plug to USB. I whiped up the PCB in about an hour, so there might be errors at the moment. Also, please do not plug an ethernet cord into the adapter, it might do weird things (or nothing at all)!

I've included the PCB files (EAGLE and Gerber), BOM and all of Soarer's files relevent to the PCB. I <i><b>in no way take</b></i> responsibity for creating or modifying the files in the soarers-files folder, all credit goes to Soarer. If you want more info on the original project, check out Soarer's guide [here](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2510&start=).
